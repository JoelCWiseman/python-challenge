# python-challenge

In the linked files I have created pyhton scripts that evaalute the provided data based on data asks in the Challenge request.

For the budget data file I created a Financial Analysis that prints in the Termainl and writes a .txt file that pulls out the following data points 1) Total Months, 2) Total (In $), 3) Average Change (in $), 4) Greatest Increase in Profits (Date and Amount in $), 5) Greatest Decrease in Profits (Date and Amount in $).

For the election data file I created a Election Results script that prints in the Terminal and writes a .txt file that pulls out the follinw data points 1) Total Votes Cast, 2) Candidate names, and associates their vote totals and percentage, 3) Declares the winner of the election.

For both of these python scripts I was able to rely on the in class examples, as well as referencing information from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/#. Additionally, I purchased a copy of Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter 3rd Editiion by Wes McKinney (https://wesmckinney.com/book/) which provided further clarification on the current challenge, and will provide additional support as we move into Jupyter and Pandas.
